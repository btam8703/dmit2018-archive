# Take-Home Exercises

> Benjamin Tam

## General Instructions

Your solution to the **Take-home exercises** are to be placed in this repository. You will be given `.patch` files for each take-home exercise that you will need to apply to your repository. Git patch files can be applied by running the `git apply` command on your local repository. Once the patch is applied, the files/changes needed for your assignment will be in your working directory and can be staged/committed.

For example, if you are given a patch file named "**assignment.patch**", you would first place the file in the root of your repository. Then open a command or Powershell prompt at the root of the repository. Apply the patch and commit it using the following commands.

```powershell
git apply assignment.patch
git add .
git commit -m "Assignment instructions added"
```
